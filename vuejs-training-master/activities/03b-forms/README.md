# Instructions

- Use the Vue CLI to create a new project.
- Create a login folder.
- Create a `LoginPage` component in the login folder and add it to `App.vue`.
- In the `LoginPage` component, create a form that has input fields for 3 value: user name, email address, and API key.
- Add a Login button that saves the entered data into localStorage and then puts up an alert saying that the data was saved.
- Make it so that if you hit the Enter key on an input field, it behaves the same way as clicking the Login button.
- Make sure that neither clicking the button nor hitting Enter reload the page.
